            Speaker: Dr. Kerry Armstrong & Mr. Dale Steinhardt<br>
            Purpose: To outline the definition of 'hooning', the dangers of street racing, and the laws preventing street racing from occuring.<br>
            Audience: Anyone interested in the dangers of 'hooning' and streetracing.<br>
            Context: The results of a new study on streetracing have come out, circa 2002-2004.<br>
            Exigence: There was a new system of 'anti-hooning' legislation in Queensland, New Zealand.<br>
            Choices: The author inserts quotes from people within the streetracing and track day community to show that the car isn't what is dangerous it is the driver. The author also uses a calm tone in order to present all of the information as clearly as possible.<br>
            Appeals: The author makes appeals to one's logical reasoning skills in order to show that those into cars might actually be safer than those who are not as people into cars and racing may have better control over their vehicles than the average person does.<br>
            Tone: The author uses a calm tone in order to present all information clearly.

            Although 'anti-hooning' regulation may reduce the amount of traffic accidents on the road overall, it generally increases distrust and want for a more underground racing scene. Having none of these laws could encourage safer driving in these situations as people would not need to hide their activities from police so that the police could always be sanctioning these street events. This would allow for police to quickly arrive on scene in the event of a crash. However, skilled drivers who enjoy ‘hooning’ would not need police around but would still be able to ‘hoon’ safely. This would further encourage people to want to learn how to control their cars, often with more controllability when tuned than the average car when stock, better by practicing in empty areas such as a parking lot or backroads. Removing ‘anti-hooning’ laws would also provide a way for those interested in cars to have fun without needing to travel to track days or spend the high track fees, often taking hours to drive to and sometimes hundreds of dollars to enter and drive on a track. These great costs and time sinks make it so that much of the population may not be able to afford to go to tracks to learn how to control their cars better. For example the ‘Porsche Experience Test Track’ at cheapest costs 515 US dollars to learn to drive spiritedly in a base model 718 Cayman, but can easily go up to 2795 USD for the top of the line Accelerated 718 Cayman GT4 RS.
