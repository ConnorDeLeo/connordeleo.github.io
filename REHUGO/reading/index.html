            Speaker: Dr. Kerry Armstrong & Mr. Dale Steinhardt<br>
            Purpose: To outline the definition of 'hooning', the dangers of street racing, and the laws preventing street racing from occuring.<br>
            Audience: Anyone interested in the dangers of 'hooning' and streetracing.<br>
            Context: The results of a new study on streetracing have come out, circa 2002-2004.<br>
            Exigence: There was a new system of 'anti-hooning' legislation in Queensland, New Zealand.<br>
            Choices: The authors insert quotes from people within the streetracing and track day community to show that the car isn't what is dangerous it is the driver. The author also uses a calm tone in order to present all of the information as clearly as possible.<br>
            Appeals: The authors make appeals to one's logical reasoning skills in order to show that those into cars might actually be safer than those who are not as people into cars and racing may have better control over their vehicles than the average person does.<br>
            Tone: The authors use a calm tone in order to present all information clearly.

            Although 'anti-hooning' regulation may reduce the amount of traffic accidents on the road overall, it generally increases distrust and want for a more underground racing scene. Having none of these laws could encourage safer driving in these situations as people would not need to hide their activities from police so that the police could always be sanctioning these street events. This would allow for police to quickly arrive on scene in the event of a crash. However, skilled drivers who enjoy ‘hooning’ would not need police around but would still be able to ‘hoon’ safely. This would further encourage people to want to learn how to control their cars, often with more controllability when tuned than the average car when stock, better by practicing in empty areas such as a parking lot or backroads. Removing ‘anti-hooning’ laws would also provide a way for those interested in cars to have fun without needing to travel to track days or spend the high track fees, often taking hours to drive to and sometimes hundreds of dollars to enter and drive on a track. These great costs and time sinks make it so that much of the population may not be able to afford to go to tracks to learn how to control their cars better. For example the ‘Porsche Experience Test Track’ at cheapest costs 515 US dollars to learn to drive spiritedly in a base model 718 Cayman, but can easily go up to 2795 USD for the top of the line Accelerated 718 Cayman GT4 RS.

            Speaker: Deanne Daigle, Jane Seely, and Evelyn Vingilis<br>
            Purpose: Find out how much newspapers were exaggerating the amount of accidents caused by street racing.<br>
            Audience: The average person living in Canada wanting to be informed about how trustworthy newspapers are on different subjects.<br>
            Context: Newspaper articles can not be trusted as a metric for the amount of street racing because they overinterpret the amount of accidents caused by street racing and not just reckless driving.<br>
            Exigence: New Ontario street racing legislation was passed in 2007.<br>
            Choices: The authors chose to include tables and percentages in order to convey more information and include all data used in the experiment.<br>
            Appeals: The essay authors use an appeal to logical reasoning as they use hard data such as percentages and numbers.<br>
            Tone: The authors use a calm tone presenting all facts as clearly as possible.

        <p class="writeup">
            There are many occasions in which people attribute motor vehicle crashes to street racing simply because the perpetrator was a young male driving a modified car. This however, is not the case very often as seen in the text. The text states that only 2.6 percent of accidents involved fatalities and street racing. The populace would be seeing this as higher than it actually was as over 50 percent of episodic articles highlighting accidents involved streetracing. This gives a bad rep for street racers and general ‘hoonigans’ that are skilled enough to not cause fatal accidents, which is 97.4 percent of street racers. Street racing laws shouldn’t be as strict as they are towards skilled drivers as one can be skilled enough to compete in the big leagues such as F1, IndyCar, NASCAR, and Formula Drift, but can not afford to compete in them or even on smaller track events. Street racing laws also further this bad reputation that voluntary participants gain as they attract more media attention towards the few and far between accidents. Take H2Oi for example, a tragic event, yet a rare example. These small examples only containing one or two fatalities are nothing compared to the mass amounts of accidents caused by texting or being drunk while driving, a massive number when combined. Many factors that kill pedestrians and drivers on the road are far greater than street racing, including but not limited to the aforementioned texting and being drunk while driving. All in all, street racers get a much worse representation than they should.
