                Review:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">Both of these Past Gas podcast episodes are related to Japanese street racing and the Midnight Club. In the first episode, James Pumphrey and Nolan Sykes demystify the Midnight Club by showing off its full history, from how it was started all the way to the downfall of Midnight Club. James and Nolan also go through the dangers of street racing, but also how exhilarating it could be. They also cover how it relates to Japanese car culture. In the second episode, Pumphrey and Sykes cover the general fall of street racing in Japan as the year closed onto 2000 and the unfortunate accident that caused the downfall of the Midnight Club. In the second episode James and Nolan also went over the Midnight Club and street racing’s general affect over Japanese car culture and its lead into 2000s The Fast and The Furious series, a movie series greatly influenced by Japanese street racing culture with the massive amount of Japanese tuner vehicles such as those in the initial scene of the first movie containing a Mazda FD Rx-7, a Honda Civic Type-R, a Acura (or Honda in Japan) Integra, and a Mitsubishi Eclipse. The Fast and The Furious were heavily influenced by the 1980s and 1990s Japanese street racing as was much of the early 2000s era car culture. Another media greatly influenced by the Midnight Club that James and Nolan speak about was Wangan Midnight, an anime and manga where hashiriya (Japanese word for street racer) raced on the Wangan highway in tuned cars. Both of the Past Gas episodes released information about how the Midnight Club and Japanese street racing influenced car culture and its history.</p>
