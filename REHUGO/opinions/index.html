                Analysis:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">This meme is showing how street racing is not a good thing to do. It also shows how street racers can be extremely skilled as the car in the back, a Toyota Corolla Sprinter Trueno AE86 GT-Apex driven by Takumi Fujiwara. The meme is quite effective at getting the point of street racing isn’t good, but drivers can be very skilled as long as you understand the reference to Initial D, a popular anime about touge driving in Japan (a form of Japanese street racing). The meme uses mainly incongruity as Hank Hill and Bobby Hill alongside their very, very American art style would never appear in Initial D.</p>

                Response:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">Takumi Fujiwara is an extremely skilled racer hailing from the Gunma prefecture of Japan based on Keiichi Tsuchiya, the “Drift King”, racing in Project.D. This extremely relates to my question of “Should the Midnight Club Street Racing have been Illegal?” as the drivers of the Midnight Club are extremely skilled, just like Takumi Fujiwara in Initial D, participating in the team “Project.D”. The plot of Initial D also leads to ask if the skilled racers of Project.D should be allowed to legally street race. As the racers only use roads blocked off by fellow racers, and they only pose a risk to themselves (alongside a few willing bystanders), as seen in multiple episodes when racers against Takumi crash or even roll their cars. When this happens, no racers are even hurt drastically due to the safety systems such as racing seats and harnesses installed in their cars. Not only these two things, but the drivers were so skilled that they could easily go above 100km/h (dictated by the beeping often found in Japanese cars from the 1980s when the car’s speedometer registered 100km/h [60mph]) and swing through turns fluidly by drifting and even with the main character, Takumi Fujiwara, dropping one of his wheels into the gutters on the sides of the roads in order to gain more grip on the outer tires. All of these techniques show off extreme skill of the drivers and may prove that they should be allowed to street race legally.</p>

                Analysis:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">This meme is showing the dangers of street racing with high horsepower cars and unskilled drivers. This meme uses reversal as the car should not be in the water crashed into a tree. To fully understand the joke you must know the car, a fourth generation Chevrolet Camaro often called the “Catfish Camaro, the joke being that as the car is called the “catfish” it is in an actual catfish’s natural habitat. Once this meme is understood it is mildly affective as it doesn’t show any actual damage to the car.</p>

                Response:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">This meme comments on the dangers of street racing with low skill drivers. This relates to my question of “Should the Midnight Club Street Racing have been Illegal?” as the drivers in Midnight Club were extremely skilled, while the driver of the generation four “Catfish” Camaro is, quite obviously, not very skilled of a driver. The street racers, referred to in the meme as street outlaws, who are not skilled enough to not even crash into a tree, coincidentally also a pond or marsh, obviously should not be allowed to legally street race, but should skilled racers be? In my opinion, there should be an extremely hard to obtain, but still feasible, racing license in order to be able to race on public roads. Something as hard to get as to need hundreds of track race hours under your belt, including something along the lines of needing to race with a certain number of other drivers on the track (to simulate an amount of traffic on a public road). There may also be different tiers of licenses for different amounts of traffic, such as open roads versus mountain passes (the Tail of the Dragon for example) versus busy freeways. The people who act as the Camaro driver in the meme did, would not be able to gain the licenses necessary to race on the streets legally seeing as they do not have the skill needed. When these unlicensed drivers raced on public roads they would simply be charged as normal per state or federal law.</p>
