                VVT
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">A majorly significant invention that led to the massive horsepower numbers achieved by members of the Midnight Club. VVT stands for Variable Valve Timing, the valves being controlled by cams in the engine opening for air intake and exhaust outlet. VVT was initially developed for road cars by Honda, introducing the system into their sport models of the Civic, CRX, and the legendary Japanese supercar, the NS-X (New Sportscar eXperimental) in the form of VTEC (Valve Timing Electronic Control). Multiple other Japanese companies would quickly introduce some form of VVT into their cars such as Nissan with their Neo VVL (Variable Valve Lift [same principles as VVT, different word as the valves “lift”]) or Mitsubishi’s MIVEC (Mitsubishi Innovated Valve timing Electronic Control). VVT allows engines to have a flatter power band (horsepower and torque over rpm) with steeper upward slopes. This steeper power band with a wider plateau is due to the increased amount of air allowed to get into the engine’s cylinders from the valves being opened longer and open later alongside the exhaust being able to escape while air is rushing in making less wasted gaseous space. VVT systems also allow for more fuel efficiency in economy vehicles due to these same reasons with a specific tune. Some race cars, such as the infamous four rotor powered, LeMans winning Mazda 787b, used an offshoot system of VVT called CVVT. CVVT, or Continuously Variable Valve Timing, uses either hydraulic or pneumatic systems in order to open or close the valves as opposed to the much more common camshaft system.</p>

                Smokey Nagata Midnight 200mph Blast
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">This short documentary series (compiled into one longer video) follows one infamous Japanese tuner and street racer Kazuhiko “Smokey” Nagata through his speed seeking adventures. The documentary first shows off Smokey’s Toyota A80 Supra powered by a Nissan RB26 DETT (RB being the engine code, 26 being the litres [2.6L], D for Dual overhead cams, E for Electronic fuel injection, and TT for Twin Turbo) from a Nissan GT-R (RB power!) and his runs on the Wangan, a Japanese highway famously raced on by the Midnight Club, with a Jun’s Garage tuned Nissan r33 GT-R, also powered by a Nissan RB26 DETT. Then the documentary cuts to Smokey in England, on his way to do a 300 kilometer per hour pull (a term used to designate a long period of acceleration). Smokey unfortunately only was able to make it to 298 km/h and was promptly arrested by, quite rude and racist, British police. Luckily Smokey was able to hide the recording tapes in his pants so that the magazine Option (a Japanese street car, racing, and tuning magazine with multiple sections such as Drift Tengoku, or Drift Heaven) could receive the footage and publish it in this documentary series. Nagata was quickly arrested and extradited back to Japan where he was released. After the completion of the Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line, Smokey was one of the first on the highway in his new Supra, also RB26 DETT powered, being monitored by the police and after moving away from them, he did burnouts and was chased down by Bee Racing’s Nissan Kouki S14. Smokey would then host a car show in Auckland, New Zealand and break more speed records on their public highways in the downpour of rain. Finally to end the documentary series, Nagata flies down the Autobahn in Germany in his Nissan V35 Skyline converted into a GT-R mockup.</p>

                Keiichi Tsuchiya: Who is The Drift King?
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">Keiichi Tsuchiya is one of the most prolific street racers still alive. His initial career started by racing on the mountain roads of Japan at night in his Toyota Sprinter Trueno GT-Apex AE86. Tsuchiya copied a driver he greatly looked up to’s, Kunimitsu Takahashi (Who’s name may have inspired the “Rotary Brothers” both with the last name of Takahashi), driving style. His style used a lot of drifting in corners while losing minimal speed, more of a power slide than a true drift (powersliding being all four wheels slipping while drifting is only the rear wheels sliding). Keiichi Tsuchiya then went into legal racing most iconically in the team Taisan Advan adorned Nissan Skyline Nismo r32 GT-R, a car which won every race it entered in (with the r32 GT-R earning the nickname “Godzilla”). Tsuchiya also iconically won two class wins at LeMans, albeit driving less iconic cars. To earn his title of “Drift King” he had to have a bit more to do with drifting than his initial illegal racing career so he starred in the video series “Plupsy”. Plupsy was a short film series, one of if not the first video of drifting, featuring one of his AE86s, this time a Levin as opposed to the more iconic Trueno. After the video released, Keiichi would meet with the owner of <i>Option Magazine</i>, and would start the D1 Grand Prix series with its debut in 2000 at Ebisu circuit, the most famous drifting track in Japan and possibly the world. Tsuchiya also created the “Drift Bible” a small video series showing viewers how they can drift in real life. All of these achievements contributed to his title of the “Drift King”.</p>
