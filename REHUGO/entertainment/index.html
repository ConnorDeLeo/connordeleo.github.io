                Review:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">
                The Midnight Club was an extremely skilled group of drivers racing on both the Wangan expressway and the touge, a word meaning “mountain pass” in Japanese, but primarily the Wangan expressway. Midnight Club was built from the top businessmen in Japan who had enough money to buy, and modify almost every part of, the nicest cars on the market, from Nissan Skylines to Porsche 911s. Not only did these businessmen have to be rich enough to buy nice cars, they also had to be skilled enough to drive them at their max speeds. Racing in the Midnight Club was extremely strict, with multiple rules preventing members from doing certain things such as racing against other teams or being kicked out of the race team for crashing. The fastest in Midnight Club were also revered as some of the fastest in Japan, and even the entire world. This extreme speed required for Midnight Club also allowed their members to never get caught as the police at the time were limited to 110 kilometers per hour, a number only a third of the speeds that many Midnight Club members raced at. One of the fastest in the Midnight Club, Yoshida san, who also happened to be a founding member, drove a Porsche 911 930 generation outfitted with the parts of a 911 RSR and a 935 racecar. This car clocked an official top speed of 308 kilometers per hour, 191.38 miles per hour, on Yotabe Circuit and an unofficial, due to its illegality, top speed of 340 kilometers per hour, 211.27 miles per hour, on the Wangan expressway. Other cars included a 600 wheel horsepower Nissan 240z, a Honda Today (suprising due to its nature as a Kei Car, meaning small car), Toyota A80 Supras, a Lamborghini Countach, Nissan Skyline GTRs (R32 through the R34 generations, and a Ferrari 348. All of these cars had one connecting feature, they all had to be able to consistently run 250 plus kilometers per hour, 155.34 plus miles per hour, on the Wangan expressway. The drivers also had to go through a year long period in which they would be trained with a pink sticker on the back of their car, after the year of being required to show up to every meeting and not crashing or losing to another team, they would earn the coveted silver sticker, marking them as an official member of the club. Those who would run team Midnight Club’s stickers on their cars when they weren’t in the club or had been kicked out, would get their windshields smashed in mysteriously in the night. In the end, a crash caused by a race between the Midnight Club team racers and a rival motorcycle gang killed pedestrians causing the immedate shutdown of the entire club. Although the Midnight Club was illegal, the race team was still revered as some of the best drivers and the best street racers in the world. Now the question is, should the Midnight Club street racing have been illegal?

                Review:
            </h3>
            <p class="writeup">
                <i>The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift</i> is a movie part of the <i>Fast and Furious </i>franchise being the third movie made, and the sixth movie in chronological order. <i>Tokyo Drift</i> has been nominated for multiple awards including the <i>MTV Movie + TV Awards</i>, the <i>Teen Choice Awards</i>, and the <i>World Stunt Awards</i>. The movie has only won a single award in the <i>MTV Movie + TV Awards</i>, the <i>MTV Generation Award</i>. I feel as though this movie is very deserving of the <i>MTV Generation Award</i>. I feel this way because of the way the cars mesh into the storyline and how the characters develop. The cars are, quite obviously, a central part of the story being a <i>Fast and Furious</i> film. However, the way they are meshed in is completely different to every other <i>Fast and Furious</i> movie that I have seen. The cultural aspect of cars in Japan is almost nailed to a tee, save for the amount of kei cars, trucks, and vans alongside solely track or even touge focused cars which are severely lacking from the movie, and is carefully intertwined with the dialogue (i.e. most dialogue is correct and not just blabbing buzz words somewhat related to cars, automotive engineering, and / or tuning) and actions of the characters (i.e. having realistic steering wheel movements and actions to develop car plot such as sean obviously not caring about his cars as being shown in the first race and his first drift race in Japan). The characters also develop in an extremely eloquent and detailed manner, albeit with some small jumps, and is the perfect match to the cars with amazing personality. Many cars in the movie were provided by Sean Morris at Top Rank Importers (Whom I almost interned with) alongside some being created by RMR (for example, the red Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution IX with a rear wheel drive conversion kit to allow it to drift [oddly having a Lancer Evolution VIII MR front bumper]). The plot is also relatively good, extremely good for a <i>Fast and Furious</i>  movie. The plot is extremely linear and easy to follow throughout the entire movie. Without spoiling too much the chase scene towards the end of the movie with Sean’s Lancer Evolution IX, Han’s Veilside Mazda Rx7, DK’s Veilside Nissan Fairlady Z, and his gooney’s Nissan Veilside Fairlady Z alongside the last “touge” style race between Sean and his Mustang Fastback (powered by an rb26 out of a Nissan Skyline GTR [rb power!]) and DK’s Veilside Z are the best two races in the entire movie. Both these races have a major impact on the story and have very good driving action. Although the characters’ dialogue and the plot is a little goofy, it is still a great movie deserving of the award, especially since they contracted the real drift king (not some character simply imitating a shadow of what he could really do), Keiichi Tsuchiya, as a fisherman during Sean’s drift training scenes. <i>The Fast and The Furious: Tokyo Drift</i> is truly deserving of the <i>MTV Generation Award</i>.
